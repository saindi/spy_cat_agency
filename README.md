# Spy Cat Agency API

This repository contains the backend API for the Spy Cat Agency, a sophisticated organization for managing feline espionage operations. Built with FastAPI, this application provides a robust system for creating, tracking, and managing spy cats, their missions, and their targets.

The API follows modern design principles, utilizing a unit of work and repository pattern for clean, maintainable, and testable code.

## ‚ú® Features

*   **Spy Cat Management**: Full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for spy cats.
*   **Mission Management**: Full CRUD operations for missions, including the ability to define multiple targets.
*   **Mission Assignment**: Assign available spy cats to missions.
*   **Target Tracking**: Update the status and details of individual targets within a mission.
*   **Automatic Mission Completion**: Missions are automatically marked as complete once all their targets are neutralized.
*   **Data Validation**: Uses Pydantic for robust request validation, including checking for valid cat breeds against an external API.
*   **Paginated Responses**: All list endpoints provide paginated results for efficient data handling.
*   **Asynchronous Operations**: Fully async from the database (PostgreSQL with `asyncpg`) to the API endpoints for high performance.
*   **Database Migrations**: Uses Alembic to manage database schema evolution.

## üöÄ Technology Stack

*   **Framework**: FastAPI
*   **Database**: PostgreSQL
*   **ORM**: SQLAlchemy 2.0 (async)
*   **Migrations**: Alembic
*   **Validation**: Pydantic
*   **Containerization**: Docker & Docker Compose
*   **Linting/Formatting**: Ruff, pre-commit, mypy

## üì¨ Postman Collection

A ready-to-use Postman collection is provided to test all endpoints for Cats and Missions. You can use it to quickly interact with the API, send requests, and view responses.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Getting Started

To run the application locally using Docker, follow these steps.

### Prerequisites

*   Docker
*   Docker Compose

### Installation and Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/saindi/spy_cat_agency.git
    cd spy_cat_agency
    ```

2.  **Create Docker Network and Volume:**
    The application requires an external Docker network and volume for communication and data persistence.
    ```bash
    docker network create spy_cat_network
    docker volume create spy_cat_agency_pg_data
    ```

3.  **Configure Environment Variables:**
    Create a `.env` file by copying the sample file.
    ```bash
    cp .env.sample .env
    ```
    Now, open the `.env` file and fill in the required values.

4.  **Run the Application:**
    Use Docker Compose to build and run the services.
    ```bash
    docker-compose up --build
    ```
    The API will be accessible at `http://<SERVER_HOST>:<SERVER_PORT>`, for example, `http://localhost:8000`. The interactive API documentation (Swagger UI) will be available at `http://localhost:8000/docs`.

### Database Migrations

Database migrations are managed by Alembic. The `app-start.sh` script automatically applies the latest migrations every time the application container starts, ensuring the database schema is always up-to-date.

### Linting

This project uses `pre-commit` with `ruff` and `mypy` for code linting and formatting. To run the checks manually, use the provided script:
```bash
./lint.sh
```

## üìÇ Project Structure
